# Password Manager
In a world where you must remember every password and username so hackers won't steal your money, dignity, and/or life, my solution is to just put the creds in a vault and forget about it. Keep it local, keep it on a protected server, or in a private network. Either way, this is an easy way to manage a large about of user creds or client creds.
